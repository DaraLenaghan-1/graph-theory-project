    "The Graph Isomorphism Problem is a mathematical problem that asks whether two given graphs are the same in structure, meaning they have the same number of nodes, the same number of edges, and edges connect nodes in the same way. In simpler terms, it is the problem of determining if two graphs look the same, regardless of the labels on their nodes. The problem is considered challenging because there is no known efficient algorithm for solving it in all cases, and it is one of a few mathematical problems for which no fast solution has been found."
