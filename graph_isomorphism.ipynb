    "#  Graph Isomorphism Problem.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph Isomorphism Problem is a mathematical problem that asks whether two given graphs are the same in structure, meaning they have the same number of nodes, the same number of edges, and edges connect nodes in the same way. In simpler terms, it is the problem of determining if two graphs look the same, regardless of the labels on their nodes. The problem is considered challenging because there is no known efficient algorithm for solving it in all cases, and it is one of a few mathematical problems for which no fast solution has been found."

    "### Problem and its Significance\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph Isomorphism Problem is a fundamental problem in computer science and mathematics that has challenged researchers for decades. Simply put, the problem asks whether two given graphs are isomorphic or not. An isomorphism between two graphs is a bijective function that preserves the adjacency relationships between the vertices of the graphs. If such an isomorphism exists, the two graphs are said to be isomorphic; otherwise, they are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph Isomorphism Problem is important for a number of reasons. First, it is a basic problem in computational group theory and has implications for other areas of mathematics such as the study of groups and symmetry. Second, it is relevant to many areas of computer science such as network analysis, computational biology, and cryptography. Third, graph isomorphism is closely related to other problems in complexity theory such as the hidden subgroup problem, which is used in quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite decades of research, the Graph Isomorphism Problem remains a challenging problem to solve. It is not known whether the problem is in P, NP-complete, or some intermediate level of complexity. Furthermore, the problem has important practical applications such as in the analysis of chemical structures and in cryptography. Therefore, finding a fast algorithm for the Graph Isomorphism Problem would have important implications for both theoretical and practical areas of computer science and mathematics."

    "A graph is a mathematical object consisting of a set of vertices and a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices. Formally, a graph G can be represented as a pair (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges. An edge is an unordered pair of vertices (u, v), denoted by {u, v}, that represents a connection between the two vertices. A graph can be directed or undirected, and can also have weighted edges that indicate the strength or distance between vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two graphs G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), an isomorphism between the two graphs is a bijective function f: V1 -> V2 that preserves the adjacency relationships between the vertices. That is, for every edge {u, v} in E1, there must be a corresponding edge {f(u), f(v)} in E2, and for every edge {u, v} in E2, there must be a corresponding edge {f^(-1)(u), f^(-1)(v)} in E1. Here, f^(-1) denotes the inverse function of f. If such an isomorphism exists, the two graphs G1 and G2 are said to be isomorphic.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a graph isomorphism between G1 and G2 is a function f: V1 -> V2 that satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "f is a bijection (i.e., f is one-to-one and onto)\n",
    "For any pair of vertices u, v in V1, {u, v} is an edge in E1 if and only if {f(u), f(v)} is an edge in E2.\n",
    "If such a function f exists, we say that G1 and G2 are isomorphic, denoted as G1 â‰… G2."

    "### Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "There are several algorithms for solving the Graph Isomorphism Problem, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the most well-known algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brute force search: The simplest algorithm for graph isomorphism is to generate all possible permutations of the vertices of the two graphs, and check if there exists a permutation that maps one graph to the other. While this approach is conceptually simple, it is not practical for large graphs, as the number of possible permutations grows exponentially with the size of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm: This algorithm is based on a method for graph coloring known as the Weisfeiler-Lehman refinement procedure. The algorithm involves iteratively assigning a color to each vertex based on the colors of its neighbors, and comparing the resulting color sequences of the two graphs. The algorithm has a worst-case complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of vertices in the graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nauty algorithm: This algorithm is a highly optimized implementation of the canonical labeling approach, which involves finding a unique labeling of each vertex in the graphs such that isomorphic graphs have the same labeling. The Nauty algorithm uses a variety of techniques to reduce the search space and improve efficiency, and is one of the fastest algorithms for graph isomorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "- VF2 algorithm: This algorithm is based on a backtracking search approach, where a mapping between the vertices of the two graphs is constructed incrementally. The algorithm uses a variety of heuristics to prune the search space and improve efficiency, and has a worst-case complexity of O(n!). The VF2 algorithm is often used as a baseline for comparing the performance of other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LAD algorithm: The LAD (Labeled Asymmetric Double) algorithm is a recent algorithm that uses a different approach to solving graph isomorphism, by considering a labeled version of the adjacency matrix of the two graphs. The algorithm is based on a combination of matrix factorization and graph partitioning techniques, and has been shown to be highly effective for large graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the graphs being considered. For example, the Nauty algorithm is often used for small to medium-sized graphs, while the LAD algorithm may be more effective for very large graphs."

    "### Complexity Theory\n",
    "***\n",
    "The complexity theory problem of P vs NP is directly relevant to the Graph Isomorphism Problem, as the problem is known to be in the complexity class NP.\n",
    "\n",
    "If P = NP, then it would be possible to solve the Graph Isomorphism Problem (as well as all other problems in NP) in polynomial time, using a deterministic algorithm. However, if P != NP, then there is no known deterministic algorithm that can solve the problem in polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph Isomorphism Problem is also closely related to other problems in complexity theory, such as the problem of computing the automorphism group of a graph, which is known to be in the complexity class GI-complete (Graph Isomorphism-complete). A problem is said to be GI-complete if it is at least as hard as the Graph Isomorphism Problem in terms of worst-case time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best known algorithms for graph isomorphism have worst-case time complexity that ranges from polynomial to exponential, but none of them have been shown to be polynomial-time algorithms. It is an open question whether the Graph Isomorphism Problem is solvable in polynomial time or not, and the resolution of this question would have significant implications for complexity theory and theoretical computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Graph Isomorphism Problem is an important problem in complexity theory, as it is known to be in the complexity class NP and its worst-case time complexity is not fully understood. The resolution of the P vs NP problem would have direct implications for the complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem, as well as many other important computational problems."
