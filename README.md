# Graph Theory Project
***
Project Plan
1. Introduction: Begin by introducing the problem and its significance. Explain what graph isomorphism is and why it is important.
2. Mathematical Foundations: Provide the mathematical foundations of the Graph Isomorphism Problem, including the definition of a graph and an isomorphism between two graphs.
3. Algorithms: Discuss the various algorithms that have been proposed for solving the Graph Isomorphism Problem, such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman Algorithm, the Color Refinement Algorithm, and the Nauty algorithm.
4. Complexity Theory: Explain the complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem and why it is a difficult problem to solve. Discuss its relationship to other problems in complexity theory, such as NP-complete problems and the polynomial hierarchy.
5. Applications: Discuss the practical applications of graph isomorphism, such as in the analysis of chemical structures, computer network analysis, and cryptography.
6. Recent Developments: Discuss recent developments in the field of graph isomorphism, such as the discovery of a subexponential-time algorithm for the problem and the implications of this discovery for the field.
7. Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the project and highlight the significance of the Graph Isomorphism Problem for computer science and mathematics.
